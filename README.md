# I write shell
These are shell scripts I've written over the past 30 years.  Please note the following:
1. When I started writing these scripts, I had nearly zero experience in UNIX.  Yes, UNIX. System V R2.?  Year 1986, Bell Labs.  KSH.  Yes, the real KSH.
2. You will find a vast array of horrible syntax within.  I'm not about to start "cleaning these up" at this point.  Maybe use them as examples of how to not write scripts.
3. None of what you find here is suitable for any kind of production use.

That being said,
1. There are a lot of good examples here that provide code you can build off of to do a lot of cool things.  Use it at your will.
2. If you decide to actually use something here, and fix it, feel free to hit me up with a pull request for a merge.
3. I sincerly hope that someone can find something useful here.

Cheers
William R. Quayle
